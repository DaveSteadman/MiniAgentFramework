      "purpose": "- Execute a self-contained Python code snippet and return the captured stdout.\n- **Always prefer code over a direct answer for any calculation, sequence, table, string operation, or data generation task** - even when the answer seems obvious from training knowledge. Running code is more reliable and verifiable than recall.\n- Only Python stdlib is available; third-party packages (numpy, pandas, sympy) are not.\n- When sandbox is off (`/sandbox off`), all modules are accessible. To install and use a third-party package, use `subprocess` to pip-install it first, then import normally:\n  ```python\n  import subprocess, sys\n  subprocess.run([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", \"numpy\"], check=True)\n  import numpy as np\n  print(np.array([1,2,3]).mean())\n  ```\n- When paired with FileAccess, call this skill first to generate the content, then park the output with `scratch_save`, and pass `{scratch:key}` as the content argument to `file_write` - this avoids carrying the full output string as an inline argument through the tool-calling loop.\n- Code must use `print()` for all output. Favour simple linear code - avoid complex class hierarchies or deeply nested call stacks.",
